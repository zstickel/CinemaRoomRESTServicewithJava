<p>Always wanted to have your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like? You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets? The idea of a ticket booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that! Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please!</p></div><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/189?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/189</a>
